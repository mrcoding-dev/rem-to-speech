## Features

- Provides text to speech buttons in the flashcard queue, as well as an optional auto-play mode. (note: autoplay may not work correctly for the front of the card on some browsers due to browser limitations)

## How to Use

- Use the "Enable Text to Speech" and "Disable Text to Speech" slash commands in the editor to toggle text to speech for the focused rem and all of its descendants. Those cards will now have buttons in the flashcard queue which you can press to hear the front or the back of the card.

- Alternatively, use the options menu in the flashcard queue where you can toggle text to speech for that individual card as well as toggle the auto-play mode for all cards.

- You can customize the voice to use in the settings.
